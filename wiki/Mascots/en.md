![Don](img/Don.png "Don")

> Don is the protagonist of the [Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin) series. He is a taiko drum with a white edge and four legs, a red face (which appears to be moly orange), and a light blue body. Don's dream is to share the beauty of Taiko with the world. Three years have passed since he moved into the Wada House, and he's become quite popular around town. He has a monstrous appetite and sometimes has expensive shopping at the Wada House which may take over for the worst. He usually ends his sentences with "Ta-don", meaning "Ba-dum" in Japanese.

和田どん (Wada Don), also known as Don or Don-chan, was one of the osu! mascots for osu!taiko that joined in 2008-05. He is 48cm tall and weighs more than 100kg. He appears in the skin for osu!taiko. His art was designed by Yukiko Yokoo (横尾有希子) and was voiced by Narahashi Miki (楢橋 美紀).

## Community

### Aiko

![Aiko](img/Aiko.png "Aiko")

Designed by [JMC](/users/774010), Aiko was one of the participants in the osu!taiko mascot design contest. She is an energetic girl with a passion for osu!taiko, even if she isn't the best at it! Sporting a pair of stylish "Tabi" shoes and a retinue of pippidon accessories, the mascot of yore lives on in this spunky girl. She's fairly short at only 154cm, and was born on 1999-04-06.

### Alisa

![Alisa](img/Alisa.png "Alisa")

Designed by [\[ Glitch \]](/users/3781400), Alisa was one of the participants in the osu!taiko mascot design contest. She has been playing osu!taiko ever since her early childhood. Fond of playing songs for others, she is very musically oriented, and when she's not sleeping or eating, she's playing osu!taiko, or playing retro video games for kicks!

### Tama

![Tama](img/Tama.png "Tama")

Designed by [crystalsuicine](/users/9974), Tama was one of the younger participants in the osu!taiko mascot design contest at only age 15 (or is she?), Tama has a huge passion for taiko drumming. And thunderstorms. And especially festivals, where she snatches up any takoyaki she can find. Always up for the challenge, Tama hides a particularly mysterious past behind her youthful demeanor.

### Taikonator

![Taikonator](img/Taikonator.png "Taikonator")

Taikonator, also known as Taikonator 3000, was one of the participants in the osu!taiko mascot design contest. He has gained some traction as an inside joke and popularity for unknown reasons. His origins remains a mystery; despite this, he is far more unique than the other osu!taiko mascot design submissions and has made many appearances in various user fanart submissions.

### pyun
