# Beatmap Veto

The _beatmap veto_ allows a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators) to withhold a beatmap from Qualification if they feel there are significant issues regarding beatmap quality which make it unfit for the Ranked section.

Seeking further discussion or clarification over any kind of quality issues which you feel need to be addressed before the map can proceed with Qualification is one of your main responsibilities. 

Any Beatmap Nominator may place a beatmap veto, provided they are formally qualified for the game mode(s) in question, as stated in the [Beatmap Nominator Rules](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules).

Each beatmap veto must be discussed by both parties - the mapper as well as the Nominator placing the beatmap veto - in an attempt to reach an agreed compromise.

In cases where discussion does not take place or is inconclusive, members of the [QAT](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) (Quality Assurance Team) disqualification branch will mediate to either uphold or dismiss the veto.

## Performing a beatmap veto

As a Beatmap Nominator, you can veto a beatmap in one of two ways: 

* On older beatmaps with forum threads, place a Bubble Pop icon.
* On newer beatmaps with discussions, post a Problem stamp.

In both cases, the beatmap veto should be stated as such, and should be accompanied by a detailed explanation as to why you believe the beatmap in question should not be considered for Qualification.

A proper discussion which attempts to reach a mutual agreement by both sides of the argument must then follow.

Assuming the issues are satisfactorily resolved or justified with all parties in agreement, the Nominator may lift the beatmap veto and allow Qualification to proceed.

## What happens if no agreement is reached?

Beatmapping is extremely diverse and creative differences are to be expected. This is to be encouraged for the sake of creating a variety of content all players can enjoy! However, such differences can naturally lead to disagreements.

Where neither party can agree to compromise on an issue, the QAT will act as mediators to decide if the veto should be dismissed or upheld.

If discussion is no longer progressing after 48 hours have passed since the veto was initiated, the beatmap creator or Nominator(s) can request for mediation. If no request is received, this mediation will begin after one week, regardless of whether discussion is still ongoing or not.

During mediation, the disqualification branch of the QAT will discuss the beatmap and reasons for and against the veto. This includes an evaluation as to whether the proposed changes are deemed necessary and/or beneficial. Mediation will last for no longer than three days.

A decision to uphold or dismiss will be based on majority vote, with a minimum of either seven branch members, or half of the total members participating.

## How to proceed after mediation

Following mediation, the beatmap veto will either be dismissed if the proposed changes are deemed unnecessary or detrimental to the beatmap, or upheld if they are considered necessary or beneficial.

### Dismissed beatmap vetoes

**If the beatmap veto is dismissed**, any formally qualified Beatmap Nominator may renominate the beatmap - including the Nominator who initially nominated.

A previously uninvolved Beatmap Nominator can propose to re-initiate mediation at any point after giving their thoughts on the thread/discussion. This mediation will be evaluated as previously, taking into account the time since making the previous decision and reason given.

Beatmap Nominators may no longer overrule a beatmap veto, and must instead re-initiate mediation with the beatmap veto passing a dismissal before both they and the initial Beatmap Nominator can nominate, should they wish to do so.

The Beatmap Nominator seeking re-initiation is not required to nominate the beatmap at any future point, regardless of whether the veto is dismissed or upheld.

### Upheld beatmap vetoes

**If the beatmap veto is upheld**, the beatmap may not be re-nominated until appropriate changes are made that remedy the issues present. 

Once changes are made to the beatmap, both the Nominator performing the beatmap veto, as well as the QAT members upholding it, must recheck the beatmap and decide individually if the issues have been satisfactorily addressed.
